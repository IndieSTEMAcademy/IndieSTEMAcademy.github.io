# Fuzzy Logic
*2021-12-31, S. Schoeman*

This article will explore the interesting concepts held within **Fuzzy Logic**. First, we will explore **Logic**, the classical field.

## What is **Logic**?
Logic is the study of **propositions**, which are things that are either **TRUE** or **FALSE**. In fields such as **computer science** and **mathematics**, these true/false objects are called **Boolean variables** and are fundamental.

For what follows, let $p$ and $q$ be **independent** propositions. Using these propositions, we can form new ones by applying **logical operators** to them. The most elementary, and important, operates are:
- **AND**: "$p$ **and** $q$" is true when both $p$ and $q$ are true, and is false otherwise.
- **NOT**: "**not** $p$" is true when $p$ is false, and is false when $p$ is true.
